# Reusable UI

Reusable UI is a collection of styled React components, including HTML elements like the `<button>{:html}` and all [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/) primitives. The elements are styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

You can use Reusable UI in two ways:

1. Copy and paste the code into your project and use the components without modifying them.
2. Use Reusable UI as a reference to build your own components or design systems.

The benefit of using Reusable UI is that you save a ton of time by not having to build and style the components from scratch. You can focus on the business logic of your app.

## FAQs

### Is it available as an npm package?

No.

### Why copy/paste and not install as a dependency?

The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are constructed and styled.

We start with some sensible defaults, but you can customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation.

_The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._

### Is it ready for production?

Yes. You can use it in your production apps.

### How do I customize the colors?

I use the default Tailwind CSS colors, but you can customize them to your needs.

See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for more information.
